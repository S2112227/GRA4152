## Class and Methods test
# First, two different addresses are created as instances of the Address class
address1 = Address("15", "Sinsenveien", "Oslo", "Oslo", "0572")
address2 = Address("60", "Olav M. Troviksvei", "Oslo", "Oslo", "0862")

# The first method "print" is tested for both of the addresses created. It is expected to see the address printed in two lines
address1.print()
address2.print()

# The second method "comesBefore" is tested by comparing the postal code of the address 1 with the postal code of the address 2
# Since the postal code of the address 1 is smaller than the postal code of the address 2, the method prints a message indicating that the address 1 comes before the address 2
address1.comesBefore(address2)
